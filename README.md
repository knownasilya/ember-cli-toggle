## Install

`ember install ember-cli-toggle`

## Basic Usage

````hbs
{{x-toggle value=myValue onToggle=(mut myValue)}}
````

> by default the allowed values are boolean `true` and `false`

#### Labels

You can set both labels (what is displayed to the user) and the values associated with this label:

````hbs
{{x-toggle
  value=myValue
  showLabels=true
  onLabel='Enabled::true'
  offLabel='Disabled::false'
  onToggle=(mut myValue)
}}
````

In the above example we are disquishing between the "label" and what that label's "value" is by using the double-colon (`::`) delimiter. If `label === value` you can just put in a singular value. Also note that by default labels _are_ passed as part of the `onToggle` action but not displayed in the UI. If you want them to display then you must set `showLabels` to `true`.

#### Themes

There are many `themes` which change the visual appearance of the switch. Check the demo for examples, valid values include:

  - default
  - ios
  - light
  - flat
  - flip
  - skewed

#### Size

You can also adjust the size of the widget by use of the `size` property. Valid sizes are small, medium, and large.


This option is available on all themes but is a less sensible choice for those themes which actually
include the label within the control (e.g., `skew` and `flip`).

#### Binding / DDAU ####

The DDAU (_data down, actions up_) design pattern should be familiar to you (if not please google it and see what the fuss is about). This component plays along and publishes two actions:

- **onToggle** - whenever a click event causes the control to want to toggle this event is fired and the container is then responsible for toggling the value to the _other_ valid state.
- **onError** - if the container sets the `value` to an invalid state (aka, neither the "on" or "off" values), the component will fire a `onToggle` suggestion to move back to the "off" state but if that is denied then the component is put into a "disabled" state and this event fires.

So a basic usage would be as follows:

````hbs
{{x-toggle
  value=myValue
  onToggle=(mut myValue)
}}
````

This accepts the default on/off values of true/false and even if `myValue` starts out as "undefined" the `mut` helper will initialize the control to the "false" state. After that click on the control triggers the `onToggle` action which calls the `mut` helper's `update()` function and updates the containers `myValue`.

When we use the `action` helper instead of `mut`, the data we get back is more robust than just the new value that the toggle would like to change to. The data is packaged in a single hash that looks like this for the onToggle action:

````js
{
  code: <short-descriptive-string>,
  oldValue: <mixed>,
  newValue: <mixed>, // suggested value
  context: <object> // reference back to the toggle object giving access to all properties such as "name", etc.
}
````


### Available Options

* `theme` - One of 'light', 'ios', 'flat', 'flip', 'skewed', 'default'.
            Defaults to 'default' if not specified.
* `size` -  One of 'small', 'medium', 'large'.
            Defaults to 'medium' if not specified.
* `onLabel` - The label for the *on* state. Defaults to 'On'.
* `offLabel` - The label for the *off* state. Defaults to 'Off'.
* `showLabels` - Defaults to 'false', if 'true' will display labels on left and ride side of toggle switch
* `disabled` - Defaults to `false`, which means you can click the toggle.
  When `true`, an `.x-toggle-disabled` class is set on the toggle and an `.x-toggle-container-disabled` class is set on the component.
* `name` - A name to differentiate multiple toggles, gets passed to the `toggle` action. Defaults to 'default'.

### Configuring

Add a configuration for `ember-cli-toggle` to include only the themes that
you will use.

```js
ENV['ember-cli-toggle'] = {
  includedThemes: ['light', 'default', 'flip'],
  excludedThemes: ['flip'],
  defaultShowLabels: true, // defaults to false
  defaultTheme: 'light',   // defaults to 'default'
  defaultSize: 'small',    // defaults to 'medium'
  defaultOffLabel: 'False',     // defaults to 'Off'
  defaultOnLabel: 'True'        // defaults to 'On'
};
```
> note: the IOS theme is referred to as just `ios` not `ios7` as was indicated in the originating CSS source

To exclude or not include a theme, means that it's css styles will not be bundled with
your application, thus not polluting your app.

> **Note:** including a blank array e.g. `includeThemes: []` will not include any themes, leaving
you to define your own theme styles. See the `vendor/ember-cli-toggle/themes` directory
for reference.
